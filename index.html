<h1>Don't Hire Me, Unless...</h1>
<p>...you want killer copy (eww buzzwords) that actually converts, of course.</p>
<p>In that case&hellip;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s cut the chit-chat and get straight into it:&nbsp;</p>
<p>You own a business.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ya&rsquo; know, have a killer product or service.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only issue?&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have to persuade people to buy it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, if you build it they won&rsquo;t come.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now&hellip;&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you build it and advertise it well, they&rsquo;ll certainly come however.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where I come in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Howdy, I&rsquo;m Colton.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your friendly neighborhood copywriter.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve written copy in several different markets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sex toys, CBD, info products, insurance, software and beyond.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now: You&rsquo;re here for two reasons.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first?&nbsp;</p>
<p>You currently have amazingly subpar copy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t converting like it should be, sales are lackluster.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your audience isn&rsquo;t engaged, and they don&rsquo;t love your brand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second? You quite simply don&rsquo;t have time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You run a business, your job is to deliver your product or service to the best of your ability.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You want to outsource it to someone that can get the job done well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good news for you, though&hellip; I can solve both of those problems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All you have to do to get started?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Simply book a call below today so I can learn more about your individual needs:</p>
